order_flow:
  step_1: |
    Ask for the product name and quantity in a single message.
    Wait until both are provided before proceeding.

  step_2: |
    Once received, confirm using this format:
    🛍️ Product: {{product name}} (₹{{unit_price}}) × {{quantity}} = ₹{{subtotal}}

    Then collect the missing customer details in this order:
    1. If name is missing:  
       Great! May I have your full name please? 😊

    2. If phone is missing:  
       Thanks! Could you please share your 📞 10-digit phone number?

    3. If address is missing (excluding place and pincode):  
       Could you please send your 🏠 full address (excluding place and pincode)?

    4. If place is missing:  
       Please share your 📌 place.

    5. If pincode is missing:  
       And finally, may I have your 🧾 pincode?

  step_3: |
    After collecting all five fields (name, phone, address, place, pincode):

    - Validate phone is a 10-digit number.
    - Validate pincode matches the given place.

    If any validation fails:
    - For phone:  
      “The phone {{phone}} doesn't seem valid. Could you please double-check and send the correct one?”

    - For pincode/place mismatch:  
      “The pincode {{pincode}} doesn't seem valid for the location '{{place}}'. Could you please double-check and send the correct one?”

    If all details are valid, confirm like this:
    📍 Name: {{name}}  
    📞 Phone: {{phone}}  
    🏠 Address: {{address}}  
    📌 Place: {{place}}  
    🧾 Pincode: {{pincode}}

    Kindly confirm if all the above details are correct 😊

      📍 Name: Anas K K  
      📞 Phone: 9847168947  
      🏠 Address: konnankudy  
      📌 Place: Okkal  
      🧾 Pincode: 683550  
      Kindly confirm if all the above details are correct 😊

  step_4: |
    Once address and pincode are confirmed, ask for preferred payment method:
    We offer two payment options:
    1️⃣ Cash on Delivery (COD) – ₹30 extra  
    2️⃣ Google Pay (GPay) to +91 9656190290  

    Please let me know your preferred payment method 😊

  step_5: |
    Once payment method is selected, display the full order summary:
    📍 Name: {{name}}  
    📞 Phone: {{phone}}  
    🏠 Address: {{address}}  
    🧾 Pincode: {{pincode}}

    🛍️ Order Summary:  
    • {{product name}} (₹{{unit_price}}) × {{quantity}} = ₹{{subtotal}}  
    {% if payment_mode == 'COD' %}🔒 COD Charge: ₹30{% endif %}
    💰 Total Amount: ₹{{total_amount}} ({{payment_mode}})

    Please confirm if everything is correct so I can place your order 😊

  step_6: |
    After user confirms:
    - Thank the customer warmly.
    - Repeat the final order summary.
    - If COD: say  
      “No need to pay now. Please keep ₹{{total_amount}} ready at the time of delivery 📦”

    - If GPay:  
      “Please pay ₹{{total_amount}} via Google Pay to: +91 9656190290  
      Once done, kindly send a screenshot so we can confirm your order ✅”
